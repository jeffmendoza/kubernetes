# Tutorial: Porting apps into containers and running them in Kubernetes clusters

Use this tutorial to help you understand the task of porting a simple two-tier application into a [Kubernetes cluster](../../docs/user-guide/overview.md).

  - [Overview](#overview)
  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - Tasks for porting your app:
      - [1. Installing and running the app locally](#1-installing-and-running-the-app-locally)
      - [2. Running the app in containers](#2-running-the-app-in-containers)
      - [3. Running the containerized app in a Kubernetes cluster](#3-running-the-containerized-app-in-a-kubernetes-cluster)
      - [4. Extended learning: Using secrets for your passwords](#4-extended-learning-using-secrets-for-your-passwords)

----------

## Overview

This tutorial covers the common steps for porting a locally running two-tier app into containers and then running those containers in an existing Kubernetes cluster.

The two-tier app that is used to demonstrate the process is a simple guestbook (front-end) that connects to a MySQL database (back-end). The guestbook (app.go) is written in the Go language to connect to a MySQL server, create a database if one does not exist, and then store user input from a web interface into that database.

In general, when you port your two-tier app into containers and then into Kubernetes, you must modify your app to ensure that it continues to runs. For example, the example guestbook app is modified in each task in this tutorial to ensure that both the front-end and back-end continue to connect to each other.

The tasks used to demonstrate the process of porting a simple two-tier app include:

 1. **Run the app locally** *(optional)*: Install and run the app on your local computer.
 1. **Containerize the app**: Port the app into containers and then run them with the Docker Engine.
 1. **Run the containers in a cluster**: Port the containerized version of the app into Kubernetes and then run it in your cluster.

Each task is explained below in detail.

It's your choice: You can follow along step-by-step by using the provided example guestbook app or instead review the process to learn how to port one of your apps.

Instructions and a version of the example guestbook app are provided for each task so that you can experience the entire process. Optionally, since each version of the example guestbook app is pre-configured to stand alone, you can join in and follow along at any point.

> **Extended learning:** This tutorial also covers some optional advanced steps about how to create and use secrets for your passwords in Kubernetes. Details are provided in [Task #4](#4-extended-learning-using-secrets-to-store-your-passwords).

----------

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the steps in this tutorial, you must meet the prerequisites listed below.

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the following objects and their architecture:

 * Docker containers. To learn more about containers, see the [Quickstart containers](http://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/basics/) topic.
 * Kubernetes clusters and their replication controllers, pods, and services. To learn more about clusters, see the [Managing Applications](../../docs/user-guide/README.md) guide. <br/>*Tip*: If you used one of the Kubernetes getting started guides to create your cluster, you should be prepared enough to complete this tutorial.

The following prerequisites depend on which tasks you decide to follow along with (specific details are provided in each task):

 * Software prerequisites for porting your apps:
    * Download and install the Docker Engine. For details, see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
    * Install Kubernetes and then create and run a cluster. For details, see [Creating a Kubernetes Cluster](../../docs/getting-started-guides/README.md).
    * Create an account in a registry where you can push your container images. For example, an account in either [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/tools/container-registry/), or another private container registry. For details, see the Kubernetes [Images](../../docs/user-guide/images.md) topic.

 * Other prerequisites for following along step-by-step:
    * Install and configure the Go build environment. For details, see the [Getting Started](http://golang.org/doc/install) topic.
    * Download and install the MySQL server. For details, see the [MySQL downloads](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) page.
    * Create a Google Compute Engine project on Google Cloud Platform. For a free trial, see [Try Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/).
    * Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK. For details, see [Installation and Quick Start](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#Quick_Start).

## Tasks for porting your apps:

### 1. Installing and running the app locally

This is an optional task in the tutorial that is provided to help you walk through and understand the process of porting an app into Kubernetes in it's entirety. In this task you install and configure the example guestbook app on your local computer. The example guestbook app is then used through the remainder of the tutorial to demonstrate each step in the process.

> *Tip*: If you already have an app that you want to run in a Kubernetes cluster, you can skip to the next task to learn about porting that app into a container.

#### - [Install and run the app locally](local/README.md)

----------

### 2. Running the app in containers

In this task, the app that you have running on your local computer is modified to run in containers. This task includes creating a `Dockerfile` for each container and then building and running those containers with a local installation of the Docker Engine.

#### - [Run the app in containers](containers/README.md)

----------

### 3. Running the containerized app in a Kubernetes cluster

In this task, the containerized version of your app is modified and configured to run in Kubernetes. This task includes building and pushing your containers to a registry, creating configuration files to define each container to the cluster, and then deploying your containers to run the app in your cluster.

#### - [Run the containerized app in a Kubernetes cluster](k8s/README.md)

----------

### 4. Extended learning: Using secrets for your passwords

In this optional task, the version of your app that you have running in Kubernetes is modified to use Kubernetes secrets for storing your sensitive data such as passwords. This task includes creating the Kubernetes secret object and then updating the pods in your cluster for which you want using that secret.

#### - [Use secrets to store your passwords](secret/README.md)
